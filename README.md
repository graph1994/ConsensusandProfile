# ConsensusandProfile
Consensus and Profile code that I created to solve (http://rosalind.info/problems/cons/)
Basically the first line is the ideal DNA Strand of the sample set provided. Followed by the amount of A,C,G,T in index of DNA. 
If two values are equal it will always default to what every comes first(ex. say A = 5 and T = 5 for a index, then it will input A into censenus.). data.txt is the sample set input file, while main.txt is the output file.
